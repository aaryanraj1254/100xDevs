Possible errors:
The commander library is used to create the CLI, but it's not installed as a dependency in the project. You can install it using npm like this:
npm install commander



The script assumes that the file path passed as an argument is a valid file path. If the file does not exist or is not accessible, the script will throw an error. You might want to add some error handling to handle these cases.
The script only counts the number of lines in the file. If you want to count the number of words or characters, you would need to modify the script accordingly.
